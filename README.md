# Metallic-Gear
A parody of the 1987 game Metal Gear; mostly just a proof of concept (made in Turing for a Grade 11 final project in 2013)

INSTALLATION:
Download zip, unzip and run .exe

HOW TO PLAY:
Click through the main menu, then follow instructions in-game on movement.
The goal is to reach the end of each room without being spotted by the guard(s).
These guards only see in a straight line in front of them, so most of the difficulty comes from taking advantage of their
patrol patterns.

When spotted, the game will simply exit and must be opened again (a limitation of my skill in 2013).
To make this less painful, all cutscenes are skippable by pressing any key.

Notes: 
Although the sound effects and dialogue are definitely cringey now, I assure you they were funny at the time.
Kcirtap is Patrick backwards.
Turing is horrible.
